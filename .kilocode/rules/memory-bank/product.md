# Product - SaveTheBus

## Why This Project Exists

SaveTheBus is a public advocacy platform designed to help citizens of Tamil Nadu voice their opposition to Rule 288-A, a proposed amendment to the Tamilnadu Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989. This amendment enables the hiring/leasing of private buses for regular operations that should be handled by state transport corporations.

The core issue: By allowing private hiring for regular operations, Rule 288-A creates a de facto bar on state bus procurement. This threatens public ownership of transportation infrastructure and could lead to:
- Permanent dependency on private bus operators
- Exclusion of women from free travel schemes (Vidiyal Payanam)
- Loss of service to unprofitable rural routes
- Dismantling of the social justice legacy established in 1972

## Problems It Solves

1. **Accessibility**: Makes it easy for citizens to send formal objections to the government without needing legal expertise
2. **Language Support**: Provides full bilingual support (English/Tamil) for maximum reach
3. **Time-Sensitive**: Counting down to the January 7, 2026 deadline for objections
4. **AI-Assisted**: Uses Google Gemini AI to generate personalized, well-structured objection letters
5. **Fallback System**: Provides backup templates when AI services are unavailable
