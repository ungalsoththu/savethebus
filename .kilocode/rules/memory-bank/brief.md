# SaveTheBus

Save The Bus - is a public campaign to raise objections to the 2025 proposed amendment to the section 288A of Tamilnadu Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 to enable hiring / leasing of private buses for operations of regular bus services operated by state transport corporations.

Public transit belongs to the people. Rule 288-A and its de facto procurement bar is an encroachment on public rights.

When the state skips bus procurement, it abandons the common citizen. Demand the withdrawal of the Rule 288-A hire/lease mandate.
